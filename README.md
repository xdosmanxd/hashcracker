# hashcracker
A simple python script to generate and (fast) brute force MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hashes.

How to install:

1) https://github.com/r1me75/hashcracker.git
2) cd hashcracker
3) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4) start with -> python3 hashr1me.py

You can easily generate MD5, SHA-1 and a SHA-256 hashes for your passwords.
You can also brute force those hashes.
I have tested it with rockyou.txt, it takes exactly 21 seconds to crack the last password of rockyou.txt (14.000.000).
